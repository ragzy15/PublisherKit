/// A type of object with a publisher that emits before the object has changed.

/// By default an `ObservableObject` will synthesize an `objectWillChange`
/// publisher that emits before any of its `@Published` properties changes:
///
///     class Contact: ObservableObject {
///         @Published var name: String
///         @Published var age: Int
///
///         init(name: String, age: Int) {
///             self.name = name
///             self.age = age
///         }
///
///         func haveBirthday() -> Int {
///             age += 1
///             return age
///         }
///     }
///
///     let john = Contact(name: "John Appleseed", age: 24)
///     john.objectWillChange.sink { _ in print("\(john.age) will change") }
///     print(john.haveBirthday())
///     // Prints "24 will change"
///     // Prints "25"
